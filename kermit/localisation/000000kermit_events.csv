EVTNAME42000;An Ambrosian Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC42000;The date was October 20th, 1835 when the masses finally rose from their slumber, to make their voice heard. when the furious masses stormed the Korm·nyzÛi Palota and deposed the Duke of ¡Ågostv·l, and when our enlightened revolutionary leaders formed the Nemzeti Kongresszus, which founded our glorious Ambrosian Republic in the halls of ¡Ågostv·l University two months after. Defiantly we stand against the royalist opressors, as the Revolutionary Army marches across the Alps to liberate our friends in the north from the King's tyranny. As our brothers in Venexia, Neuch‚tel, H·romhegy and Trieste rise with us, we must stand united in our struggle to end the tyranny of the rotten thrones. Arise, oppressed masses of Hungary! The time to strike is nigh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME42001;The Southern Traitors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC42001;These are troubled times, as the traitors in the abomination they called the "Ambrosian Republic" seek to destroy our glorious Kingdom. Their ragtag of bandits that they so offensively call an "army" will be inevitably, and swiftly, crushed by the might of His Majesty's Royal Army, their leaders hanged for their treason. All is not good in the royalists forces however, as infighting between His Majesty's loyalists and the petty dukes of the east may cost us the unity that is paramount for our victory. Moreover, our hold on the Alps is waning, as the western counties, led by Neuch‚tel rise up in revolt against out loyal LÈman subjects. These are issues that no doubt will be swiftly solved, and His Majesty will be back to rule ¡Ågostv·l, as is his God given right. Death to the Kongresszus! Death to the traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME42002;The Revolution Triumphant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC42002;After so long, the counties of the Western Alps have finally been liberated from the Royalist yoke! The counts and dukes that used to terrorize these lands now tremble in fear as the masses come to destroy the rotten thrones where they once sat, thinking that they were invincible. Now, it is time to rebuild and recover, and ensure that our glorious revolution lasts for a thousand years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA42002;From Neuch‚tel to the Rhine, the masses are now free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTNAME42003;The Crushed Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC42003;It has taken effort, but the rightful status quo has finally been restored. The radicals of Neuch‚tel have been crushed, their "Enlightened" ideals dispersed across the wind. Now it is time to rebuild, and ensure that a revolt of this magnitude and character never happens again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTOPTA42003;Order, restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
ambrosian_victory_title;The Broken Thrones;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
ambrosian_victory_desc;It is done. We have fought, we have struggled, and we have won. The Ambrosian Revolution is ascendant and the kings and dukes cower in fear as the masses across Hungary liberate themselves. But the revolution is the first step. It is time to start breaking down the old, feudal order. Starting with abolishing the old, feudal duchies in Styria, Carinthia, and the northwest, and cement the birth of our Ambrosian Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
royalist_victory_title;The Revolt is Squashed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
royalist_victory_desc;It is done. The revolution is dead and buried. Reduced to the confines of the history books. Now, we must make sure that this never happens again, by solidifying our rule over ¡gostv·l, Venexia, Trieste, and Neuch‚tel, and ridding our Kingdom of the pest of radicalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
